## Hi There,

- I'm a software developer based out of Berlin
- My tech stack revolves around Python
- In the backend, I enjoy working with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), my go-to framework for finding joy when
  developing webapps 😌
- For the frontend, I am currently engaged with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), the frontend framework which helped me
  transition from _that backend guy_ to _a full stack dev_, been a fun ride and on it goes further... 🙃
- Most of the code here is based around my learning and growing as a developer as well as my attempts at resolving (or
  at times mitigating) some problems encountered along my dev journey 💪🏼
- When not committing changes, I can _usually_ be found trying hard to corner the opponent's king ♔ in a game of chess
  or running - ahh yes, _Running is so Beautiful_ 😎
- Always find delight in exploring and learning new stuff. Yup, quite a curious fellow I am! 🤭

Glad to have you wandering about my repos, have fun! 🙌🏼

Cheerio!
